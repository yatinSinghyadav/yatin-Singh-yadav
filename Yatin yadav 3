Question 1
Write a Python program to merge two files into a third file.
Ans-1)


# Python program to 
# demonstrate merging 
# of two files 

  

data = data2 = "" 

  
# Reading data from file1 

with open('file1.txt') as fp: 

    data = fp.read() 

  
# Reading data from file2 

with open('file2.txt') as fp: 

    data2 = fp.read() 

  
# Merging 2 files 
# To add the data of file2 
# from next line 

data += "\n"

data += data2 

  

with open ('file3.txt', 'w') as fp: 

    fp.write(data) 




Question 2
Take two lists as input list1 = [1,2,3,4,5] and list2 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"] From that make a
dictionary ouput {1:"a", 2:"b", 3:"c", 4:"d", 5:"e"}
Ans-2)


# Python3 code to demonstrate  
# conversion of lists to dictionary 
# using dictionary comprehension 

  
# initializing lists 

list2 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"] 

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

  
# Printing original keys-value lists 

print ("Original key list is : " + str(list2)) 

print ("Original value list is : " + str(list1)) 

  
# using dictionary comprehension 
# to convert lists to dictionary 

res = {list2[i]: list1[i] for i in range(len(list2))} 

  
# Printing resultant dictionary  

print ("Resultant dictionary is : " +  str(res))
