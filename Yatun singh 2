Question 1
Write a Python program to remove empty List from List.
Ans-1)

# Python3 code to demonstrate  
# Remove empty List from List 
# using list comprehension 

  
# Initializing list  

test_list = [5, 6, [], 3, [], [], 9] 

  
# printing original list  

print("The original list is : " + str(test_list)) 

  
# Remove empty List from List 
# using list comprehension 

res = [ele for ele in test_list if ele != []] 

  
# printing result  

print ("List after empty list removal : " + str(res))



Question 2
Write a Python program to remove all duplicates words from a given sentence
Ans-2)

from collections import Counter 

  

def remov_duplicates(input): 

  

    # split input string separated by space 

    input = input.split(" ") 

  

    # joins two adjacent elements in iterable way 

    for i in range(0, len(input)): 

        input[i] = "".join(input[i]) 

  

    # now create dictionary using counter method 

    # which will have strings as key and their  

    # frequencies as value 

    UniqW = Counter(input) 

  

    # joins two adjacent elements in iterable way 

    s = " ".join(UniqW.keys()) 

    print (s) 

  
# Driver program 

if __name__ == "__main__": 

    input = 'Python is great and Java is also great'

    remov_duplicates(input) 


Question 3
Write a Python program to find all occurrences of a character in the given string
Ans-3)


# Python3 code to program to find occurrence 
# to each character in given string 

  
# initializing string  

inp_str = "GeeksforGeeks"

  
# using set() + count() to get count  
# of each element in string  
out = {x : inp_str.count(x) for x in set(inp_str )}  

  
# printing result
